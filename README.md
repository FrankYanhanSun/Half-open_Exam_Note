# 半开卷考试“大抄”Latex模板<br>Latex Template for Half-open Exam (Cheetsheet)
大学很多课程的考试采用半开卷的形式，即仅可带一张A4纸进入考场参考。因此，如何在这张A4纸上清晰地写下尽可能多的内容，就显得十分重要了。<br>
Many exams in universities are "half-open", which means that only one A4 paper can be brought for reference. Therefore, it is crucial to write as much as possible clearly on this A4 paper.<br>

## 介绍 Introduction
本仓库提供Latex模板`main.tex`，可实现A4纸横向排版并划分为八列，支持中英文及数学公式等。单张A4纸可添加巨量内容，打印出来仍清晰易读。样张请见`main.pdf`。<br>

This repository provides a Latex template `main.tex` which can arrange the content in an A4 paper horizontally and the paper is divided into eight columns. It supports Chinese and English, as well as mathematical formulas. A single A4 paper can add a lot of content, and it will still be readable after being printed. The sample can be found as `main.pdf`.<br>

## 使用方法 How to Use
- 需使用`XeLaTeX`编译<br>Compile with `XeLaTeX`
- 支持`Overleaf`。但是经测试，若将单页A4完全填满内容，会导致免费版`Overleaf`编译超时。因此，建议本地`LaTeX`配合`vscode`使用。<br>Support `Overleaf`. However, it has been found that if the content is fully filled on the A4 page, the free version of `Overleaf` will time out for compilation. Therefore, it is recommended to use `LaTeX` locally with `vscode`.

## Good News！
如果你是为了准备上海大学`23365030电子技术B`的半开卷考试而浏览到本仓库，那么恭喜你，我的样张正是基于该门课程制作，可以直接白嫖或在此基础上修改。
## 最后 The End
本人为`Latex`小白一枚，为了考试并学习`Latex`制作了本模板并开源。本模板在编译时会有一些警告但不影响使用，我也懒得修了，主打一个能用就行，当然也欢迎大家提出宝贵的修改意见。祝各位考试顺利！<br>

As a `Latex` rookie, I made this template and open-sourced it for preparating for exams and also for learning `Latex`. The template can have some warnings during compilation but they do not affect the use. I don't want to fix them since it just works! But of course, any suggestions are welcome. Good luck on your exams!<br>
